##  Architecture

This project uses a **custom MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture** built with core PHP:

- **No external frameworks**: Everything is built from scratch for maximum control
- **Custom Router**: URL routing and dispatch system
- **Database Abstraction Layer**: MySQLi-based database operations
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Permission system for three user types
- **RESTful API**: Optional JSON API endpoints
